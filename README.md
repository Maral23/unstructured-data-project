# unstructured-data-project
Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0 to Classify Different Dog Breeds.
In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.
To do this, we'll be using data from the Kaggle dog breed identification competition. It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.
